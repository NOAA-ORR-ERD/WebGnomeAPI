# These are software packages necessary to run the WebGnomeAPI web server.
# This file is designed for use with conda:
#
# so these packages can be installed with the commands:
#
#     $ conda install --file conda_requirements.txt
#
# many of the requirements are also available via pip, but they may
# have slightly different names, but you can give it a try:
#
#     $ pip install -r conda_requirements.txt
#
# All required packages should be available on the conda-forge channel

# this is intended to be installed with py_gnome
#  -- python version should already be pinned
python>=3.9,<3.11

# numpy is not strictly needed by the API, but is by gnome, etc,
# and adding it helps keep conda from trying to up- or down-grade it.
